# JAVASCRIPT Project - Quote Generator

The "Quote Generator" website is a simple yet engaging tool that fetches and displays quotes from an API with a single button click. It also includes features for sharing quotes on Twitter and is designed to be responsive for both tablets and mobile phones.

## Key features and technologies used in the development of the Quote Generator include:

### Dynamic Quote Fetching:

Utilizes the await fetch method to retrieve quotes from an API, ensuring users always see a new quote with each click.

### Responsive Design:

Employs CSS media queries to ensure the website is optimized for both tablets and mobile phones by reducing the font size for smaller devices and larger texts.

### Animated Loader:

Implements a centered animated loader using flexbox, enhancing the user interface by providing visual feedback during the quote fetching process.

### SVG Background Pattern:

Incorporates a visually appealing SVG background pattern from Hero Patterns, adding a professional touch to the website's aesthetics.
